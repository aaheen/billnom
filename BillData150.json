The responsible social services agency must make active efforts to engage the child's  parent or custodian and the child, when appropriate; establish a safety network for the family;  and provide support, guidance, and input to assist the family and the family's safety network  with developing the safety plan. The safety plan must:\n (1) address the specific allegations impacting the child's safety in the home;\n (2) incorporate family and community support to ensure the child's safety while keeping  the family intact; and\n (3) be adjusted as needed to address the child's and family's ongoing needs and support.\n The responsible social services agency is not required to establish a safety plan in a case  with allegations of sexual abuse or egregious harm.\n (c) Unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child's health or  welfare would be immediately endangered if the child were to remain in the child's home,  a court shall not order a foster care or permanent out-of-home placement of an African  American child alleged to be in need of protection or services. At each hearing regarding  an African American child who is alleged or adjudicated to be in need of child protective  services, the court shall review whether the responsible social services agency has provided  active efforts to the child and the child's family and shall require the responsible social  services agency to provide evidence and documentation that demonstrates that the agency  is providing culturally informed, strength-based, community-involved, and community-based  services to the child and the child's family.\n (d) When determining whether the responsible social services agency has made active  efforts to preserve the child's family, the court shall make findings regarding whether the  responsible social services agency made appropriate and meaningful services available to  the child's family based upon the family's specific needs. If a court determines that the  responsible social services agency did not make active efforts to preserve the family as  required by this section, the court shall order the responsible social services agency to  immediately provide active efforts to the child and child's family to preserve the family.\n[260.65] NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS; TEMPORARY OUT-OF-HOME  PLACEMENT.\n (a) Prior to or within 48 hours of the removal of a African American child from the  child's home, the responsible social services agency must make active efforts to identify  and locate the child's noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent and the child's relatives to notify  the child's parent and relatives that the child is, or will be, placed in foster care, and provide  the child's parent and relatives with a list of legal resources. The notice to the child's  noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent and relatives must also include the information  required under section 260C.221, paragraph (b). The responsible social services agency  must maintain detailed records of the agency's efforts to notify parents and relatives under  this section.\n (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 260C.219, the responsible social services  agency must assess an African American child's noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent's  ability to care for the child before placing the child in foster care. If a child's noncustodial  or nonadjudicated parent is willing and able to provide daily care for the African American  child temporarily or permanently, the court shall order that the child be placed in the home  of the noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent pursuant to section 260C.178 or 260C.201,  subdivision 1. The responsible social services agency must make active efforts to assist a  noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent with remedying any issues that may prevent the child  from being placed with the noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent.\n (c) If an African American child's noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent is unwilling  or unable to provide daily care for the child and the court has determined that the child's  continued placement in the home of the child's noncustodial or nonadjudicated parent would  endanger the child's health, safety, or welfare, the child's parent, custodian, or the child,  when appropriate, has the right to select one or more relatives who may be willing and able  to temporary care for the child. The responsible social services agency must place the child  with a selected relative after assessing the relative's willingness and ability to provide daily  care for the child. If selected relatives are not available or there is a documented safety  concern with the relative placement, the responsible social services agency shall consider  additional relatives for the child's placement.\n (d) The responsible social services agency must inform selected relatives and the child's  parent or custodian of the difference between informal kinship care arrangements and  court-ordered foster care. If a selected relative and the child's parent or custodian request  an informal kinship care arrangement for a child's placement instead of court-ordered foster  care and such an arrangement will maintain the child's safety and well-being, the responsible  social services agency shall comply with the request and inform the court of the plan for  the child. The court shall honor the request to forego a court-ordered foster care placement  of the child in favor of an informal kinship care arrangement, unless the court determines  that the request is not in the best interests of the African American child.\n (e) The responsible social services agency must make active efforts to support relatives  with whom a child is placed in completing the child foster care licensure process and  addressing barriers, disqualifications, or other issues affecting the relatives' licensure,  including but not limited to assisting relatives with requesting reconsideration of a  disqualification under section 245C.21.\n (f) The decision by a relative not be considered as an African American child's foster  care or temporary placement option shall not be a basis for the responsible social services  agency or the court to rule out the relative for placement in the future or for denying the  relative's request to be considered or selected as a foster care or permanent placement of  the child.\n[260.66] EMERGENCY REMOVAL HEARING.\n Notwithstanding section 260C.163, subdivision 3, and the provisions of Minnesota Rules  of Juvenile Protection Procedure, rule 25, a parent or custodian of an African American  child who is subject to an emergency protective care hearing pursuant to section 260C.178  and Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure, rule 30, must be represented by  counsel.

Prior to the court ordering a transfer of permanent legal and physical custody  to a relative who is not a parent, the responsible social services agency must inform the  relative of Northstar kinship assistance benefits and eligibility requirements, and of the  relative's ability to apply for benefits on behalf of the child under chapter 256N.\n Subd. 2.\nTermination of parental rights restrictions.\n(a) A court shall not terminate  the parental rights of a parent of an African American child based solely on the parent's  failure to complete case plan requirements.\n (b) A court shall not terminate the parental rights of a parent of an African American  child in a child placement proceeding unless the allegations against the parent involve sexual  abuse; egregious harm as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 14; murder in the first,  second, or third degree under section 609.185, 609.19, or 609.195; murder of an unborn  child in the first, second, or third degree under section 609.2661, 609.2662, or 609.2663;  manslaughter in the first or second degree under section 609.20 or 609.205; manslaughter  of an unborn child in the first or second degree under section 609.2664 or 609.2665; assault  in the first, second, or third degree under section 609.221, 609.222, or 609.223; domestic  assault by strangulation under section 609.2247; felony domestic assault under section  609.2242 or 609.2243; kidnapping under section 609.25; solicitation, inducement, and  promotion of prostitution under section 609.322; criminal sexual conduct under sections  609.342 to 609.3451; engaging in, hiring, or agreeing to hire a minor to engage in prostitution  under section 609.324, subdivision 1; solicitation of children to engage in sexual conduct  under section 609.352; possession of pornographic work involving minors under section  617.247; malicious punishment or neglect or endangerment of a child under section 609.377  or 609.378; use of a minor in sexual performance under section 617.246; or failing to protect  a child from an overt act or condition that constitutes egregious harm.\n (c) Nothing in this subdivision precludes the court from terminating the parental rights  of a parent of an African American child who for good cause desires to voluntarily terminate  parental rights of the parent's child under section 260C.301, subdivision 1, paragraph (a).\n Subd. 3.\nAppeals.\nNotwithstanding the Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Protection Procedure,  rule 47.02, subdivision 2, a parent of an African American child whose parental rights have  been terminated may appeal the decision within 60 days of the service of notice by the court  administrator of the filing of the court's order.\n[260.68] RESPONSIBLE SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY CONDUCT AND  CASE REVIEW.\n Subdivision 1.\nResponsible social services agency conduct.\n(a) A responsible social  services agency employee who has duties related to child protection shall not knowingly:\n (1) make untrue statements about any case involving a child alleged to be in need of  protection or services;\n (2) intentionally withhold any information that may be material to a case involving a  child alleged to be in need of protection or services; or\n (3) fabricate or falsify any documentation or evidence relating to a case involving a child  alleged to be in need of protection or services.\n (b) Any of the actions listed in paragraph (a) shall constitute grounds for adverse  employment action.\n Subd. 2.\nCommissioner notification.\n(a) When a responsible social services agency  makes a maltreatment determination involving an African American child or places an  African American child in a foster care placement, the agency shall, within seven days of  making a maltreatment determination or initiating the child's foster care placement, notify  the commissioner of the maltreatment determination or foster care placement and of the  steps that the agency has taken to investigate and remedy the conditions that led to the  maltreatment determination or foster care placement. Upon receiving this notice, the  commissioner shall review the responsible social services agency's handling of the child's  case to ensure that the case plan and services address the unique needs of the child and the  child's family and that the agency is making active efforts to reunify and preserve the child's  family. At all stages of a case involving an African American child, the responsible social  services agency shall, upon request, fully cooperate with the commissioner and the African  American Child Welfare Oversight Council and, as appropriate and as permitted under  statute, provide access to all relevant case files.\n (b) In any adoptive or preadoptive placement proceeding involving an African American  child under the guardianship of the commissioner, the responsible social services agency  shall notify the commissioner of the pending proceeding and of the right of intervention.  The notice must include the identity of the child and the child's parents whose parental rights  were terminated or who consented to the child's adoption. Upon receipt of the notice, the  commissioner shall review the case to ensure that the requirements of this act have been  met. When the responsible social services agency has identified a nonrelative as an African  American child's adoptive placement, no preadoptive or adoptive placement proceeding  may be held until at least 30 days after the commissioner receives the required notice or  until an adoption home study can be completed for a relative adoption, whichever occurs  first. If the commissioner requests additional time to prepare for the proceeding, the district  court must grant the commissioner up to 30 additional days to prepare for the proceeding.  In cases in which a responsible social services agency or party to a preadoptive or adoptive  placement knows or has reason to believe that a child is or may be African American, proof  of service upon the commissioner must be filed with the adoption petition.\n Subd. 3.\nCase review.\n(a) Each responsible social services agency shall conduct a review  of all child protection cases handled by the agency every 24 months, after establishing a  2023 baseline.

The court shall inform the respondent that the respondent  is prohibited from possessing firearms and shall issue a transfer order under section 624.7175.  The court shall also give notice to the county attorney's office, which may take action as it  deems appropriate.\n (e) The order shall have a fixed period, to be determined by the court, of not less than  six months and not more than two years, subject to renewal or extension under section  624.7173.\n (f) If there is no existing emergency order under section 624.7174 at the time an order  is granted under this section, the court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence  whether the respondent presents an immediate and present danger of bodily harm.

The court shall seal the petition  filed under this section and section 624.7144 if a respondent who consents to imposition of  an extreme risk protection order requests that the petition be sealed, unless the court finds  that there is clear and convincing evidence that the interests of the public and public safety  outweigh the disadvantages to the respondent of not sealing the petition. All extreme risk  protection orders shall remain public.\n[624.7173] SUBSEQUENT EXTENSIONS AND TERMINATION.\n (a) Upon application by any party entitled to petition for an order under section 624.7172,  and after notice to the respondent and a hearing, the court may extend the relief granted in  an existing order granted after a hearing under section 624.7172. Application for an extension  may be made any time within the three months before the expiration of the existing order.  The order may be extended for a fixed period of at least six months and not to exceed two  years, if the court makes the same findings by a preponderance of the evidence as required  for granting of an initial order under section 624.7172, subdivision 2, paragraph (d). The  court shall consider the same types of evidence as required for the initial order under section  624.7172, subdivision 2, paragraphs (b) and (c).\n (b) Upon application by the respondent to an order issued under section 624.7172, the  court may terminate an order after a hearing at which the respondent shall bear the burden  of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent does not pose a significant  danger of bodily harm to the respondent's self or to other persons by possessing a firearm.

The order shall inform the respondent that the respondent is  prohibited from possessing firearms and shall issue a transfer order under section 624.7175,  paragraph (c).\n (d) A finding by the court that there is a basis for issuing an emergency extreme risk  protection order constitutes a finding that sufficient reasons exist not to require notice under  applicable court rules governing applications for ex parte relief.\n (e) The emergency order shall have a fixed period of 14 days unless a hearing is set  under section 624.7172 on an earlier date, in which case the order shall expire upon a judge's  finding that no order is issued under section 624.7172.\n (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), the respondent shall be personally served  immediately with a copy of the emergency order and a copy of the petition and, if a hearing  is requested by the petitioner under section 624.7172, notice of the date set for the hearing.  If the petitioner does not request a hearing under section 624.7172, an order served on a  respondent under this section must include a notice advising the respondent of the right to  request a hearing challenging the issuance of the emergency order, and must be accompanied  by a form that can be used by the respondent to request a hearing.\n (g) Service of the emergency order may be made by alternate service as provided under  section 624.7172, subdivision 1, paragraph (e), provided that the petitioner files the affidavit  required under that subdivision. If the petitioner does not request a hearing under section  624.7172, the petition mailed to the respondent's residence, if known, must be accompanied  by the form for requesting a hearing described in paragraph (f).\n[624.7175] TRANSFER OF FIREARMS.\n (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), upon issuance of an extreme risk protection  order, the court shall direct the respondent to transfer any firearms the person possesses as  soon as reasonably practicable, but in no case later than 24 hours, to a federally licensed  firearms dealer or a law enforcement agency. If the respondent elects to transfer the  respondent's firearms to a law enforcement agency, the agency must accept the transfer.  The transfer may be permanent or temporary. A temporary firearm transfer only entitles  the receiving party to possess the firearm and does not transfer ownership or title. If the  respondent makes a temporary transfer, a federally licensed firearms dealer or law  enforcement agency may charge the respondent a reasonable fee to store the firearms and  may establish policies for disposal of abandoned firearms, provided these policies require  that the respondent be notified prior to disposal of abandoned firearms. If a respondent  permanently transfers the respondent's firearms to a law enforcement agency, the agency  is not required to compensate the respondent and may charge the respondent a reasonable  processing fee.\n (b) A person directed to transfer any firearms pursuant to paragraph (a) may transfer  any antique firearm, as defined in United States Code, title 18, section 921, paragraph (a),  clause (16), as amended, or a curio or relic as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title  27, section 478.11, as amended, to a relative who does not live with the respondent after  confirming that the relative may lawfully own or possess a firearm.\n (c) The respondent must file proof of transfer as provided in this paragraph.\n (1) A law enforcement agency or federally licensed firearms dealer accepting transfer  of a firearm pursuant to this section shall provide proof of transfer to the respondent. The  proof of transfer must specify whether the firearms were permanently or temporarily  transferred and must include the name of the respondent, date of transfer, and the serial  number, manufacturer, and model of all transferred firearms. If transfer is made to a federally  licensed firearms dealer, the respondent shall, within two business days after being served  with the order, file a copy of proof of transfer with the law enforcement agency and attest  that all firearms owned or possessed at the time of the order have been transferred in  accordance with this section and that the person currently does not possess any firearms. If  the respondent claims not to own or possess firearms, the respondent shall file a declaration  of nonpossession with the law enforcement agency attesting that, at the time of the order,  the respondent neither owned nor possessed any firearms, and that the respondent currently  neither owns nor possesses any firearms. If the transfer is made to a relative pursuant to  paragraph (b), the relative must sign an affidavit under oath before a notary public either  acknowledging that the respondent permanently transferred the respondent's antique firearms,  curios, or relics to the relative or agreeing to temporarily store the respondent's antique  firearms, curios, or relics until such time as the respondent is legally permitted to possess  firearms. To the extent possible, the affidavit shall indicate the serial number, make, and  model of all antique firearms, curios, or relics transferred by the respondent to the relative.\n (2) The court shall seal affidavits, proofs of transfer, and declarations of nonpossession  filed pursuant to this paragraph.\n (d) If a court issues an emergency order under section 624.7174, or makes a finding of  immediate and present danger under section 624.7172, subdivision 2, paragraph (f), and  there is probable cause to believe the respondent possesses firearms, the court shall issue a  search warrant to the local law enforcement agency to take possession of all firearms in the  respondent's possession as soon as practicable. The local law enforcement agency shall,  upon written notice from the respondent, transfer the firearms to a federally licensed firearms  dealer. Before a local law enforcement agency transfers a firearm under this paragraph, the  agency shall require the federally licensed firearms dealer receiving the firearm to submit  a proof of transfer that complies with the requirements for proofs of transfer established in  paragraph (c). The agency shall file all proofs of transfer received by the court within two  business days of the transfer. A federally licensed firearms dealer who accepts a firearm  transfer pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with paragraphs (a) and (c) as if accepting  transfer directly from the respondent. If the law enforcement agency does not receive written  notice from the respondent within three business days, the agency may charge a reasonable  fee to store the respondent's firearms. A law enforcement agency may establish policies for  disposal of abandoned firearms, provided these policies require that the respondent be  notified prior to disposal of abandoned firearms.\n[624.7176] RETURN OF FIREARMS.\n Subdivision 1.\nLaw enforcement.\nA local law enforcement agency that accepted  temporary transfer of firearms under section 624.7175 shall return the firearms to the  respondent upon request after the expiration of the order, provided the respondent is not  otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal law.\n Subd. 2.\nFirearms dealer.\nA federally licensed firearms dealer that accepted temporary  transfer of firearms under section 624.7175 shall return the transferred firearms to the  respondent upon request after the expiration of the order, provided the respondent is not  otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal law.

An application  for family or medical leave benefits is not considered a claim against an employer but is  considered a request for benefits from the family and medical benefit insurance account.  The commissioner has the responsibility for the proper payment of benefits regardless of  the level of interest or participation by an applicant or an employer in any determination or  appeal. An applicant's entitlement to benefits must be determined based upon that information  available without regard to a burden of proof. Any agreement between an applicant and an  employer is not binding on the commissioner in determining an applicant's entitlement.

The determination, which is a document  separate and distinct from a document titled a determination of eligibility or determination  of ineligibility, must be titled determination of benefit account. A determination of benefit  account must be sent to the applicant and all base period employers, by mail or electronic  transmission.\n (c) If a base period employer did not provide wage detail information for the applicant  as required under section 268B.12, the commissioner may accept an applicant certification  of wage credits, based upon the applicant's records, and issue a determination of benefit  account.\n (d) The commissioner may, at any time within 24 months from the establishment of a  benefit account, reconsider any determination of benefit account and make an amended  determination if the commissioner finds that the wage credits listed in the determination  were incorrect for any reason.

This paragraph does not apply to documents titled determinations of eligibility  or determinations of ineligibility issued.\n (e) If an amended determination of benefit account reduces the weekly benefit amount  or maximum amount of benefits available, any benefits that have been paid greater than the  applicant was entitled is an overpayment of benefits.

An application for benefits may be backdated one calendar week  before the Sunday of the week the application was actually filed if the applicant requests  the backdating within seven calendar days of the date the application is filed. An application  may be backdated only if the applicant was eligible for the benefit during the period of the  backdating.

Whether leave is to be continuous or is to be  taken intermittently or on a reduced-schedule basis, notice need only be given one time, but  the employee must advise the employer as soon as practicable if dates of scheduled leave  change or are extended, or were initially unknown. In those cases where the employee is  required to provide at least 30 days' notice of foreseeable leave and does not do so, the  employee must explain the reasons why notice was not practicable upon request from the  employer.\n (b) \"As soon as practicable\" means as soon as both possible and practical, taking into  account all of the facts and circumstances in the individual case.

Benefits are exempt from levy, execution, attachment, or any other remedy provided  for the collection of debt. Any waiver of this subdivision is void.\n Subd. 5.\nContinued insurance.\nDuring any leave for which an employee is entitled to  benefits under this chapter, the employer must maintain coverage under any group insurance  policy, group subscriber contract, or health care plan for the employee and any dependents  as if the employee was not on leave, provided, however, that the employee must continue  to pay any employee share of the cost of such benefits.\n Subd. 6.\nEmployee right to reinstatement.\n(a) On return from leave under this chapter,  an employee is entitled to be returned to the same position the employee held when leave  commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and  conditions of employment. An employee is entitled to reinstatement even if the employee  has been replaced or the employee's position has been restructured to accommodate the  employee's absence.\n (b)(1) An equivalent position is one that is virtually identical to the employee's former  position in terms of pay, benefits, and working conditions, including privileges, prerequisites,  and status. It must involve the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities,  which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility, and authority.\n (2) If an employee is no longer qualified for the position because of the employee's  inability to attend a necessary course, renew a license, fly a minimum number of hours, or  similar condition, as a result of the leave, the employee must be given a reasonable  opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon return from leave.\n (c)(1) An employee is entitled to any unconditional pay increases which may have  occurred during the leave period, such as cost of living increases. Pay increases conditioned  upon seniority, length of service, or work performed must be granted in accordance with  the employer's policy or practice with respect to other employees on an equivalent leave  status for a reason that does not qualify for leave under this chapter. An employee is entitled  to be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay premiums, such as a shift  differential. If an employee departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime, and  corresponding overtime pay, each week an employee is ordinarily entitled to such a position  on return from leave under this chapter.\n (2) Equivalent pay includes any bonus or payment, whether it is discretionary or  nondiscretionary, made to employees consistent with clause (1). If a bonus or other payment  is based on the achievement of a specified goal such as hours worked, products sold, or  perfect attendance, and the employee has not met the goal due to leave under this chapter,  the payment may be denied, unless otherwise paid to employees on an equivalent leave  status for a reason that does not qualify for leave under this chapter.\n (d) Benefits under this section include all benefits provided or made available to  employees by an employer, including group life insurance, health insurance, disability  insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether  benefits are provided by a practice or written policy of an employer through an employee  benefit plan as defined in section 3(3) of United States Code, title 29, section 1002(3).\n (1) At the end of an employee's leave under this chapter, benefits must be resumed in  the same manner and at the same levels as provided when the leave began, and subject to  any changes in benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of leave affecting  the entire workforce, unless otherwise elected by the employee. Upon return from a leave  under this chapter, an employee must not be required to requalify for any benefits the  employee enjoyed before leave began, including family or dependent coverages.\n (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any additional benefits or seniority  during a leave under this chapter. Benefits accrued at the time leave began must be available  to an employee upon return from leave.\n (3) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, leave under this chapter must  not be treated as or counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and eligibility  to participate. If the plan requires an employee to be employed on a specific date in order  to be credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions, or participation purposes,  an employee on leave under this chapter must be treated as employed on that date. Periods  of leave under this chapter need not be treated as credited service for purposes of benefit  accrual, vesting, and eligibility to participate.\n (4) Employees on leave under this chapter must be treated as if they continued to work  for purposes of changes to benefit plans. Employees on leave under this chapter are entitled  to changes in benefit plans, except those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual  during the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to the same extent they  would have qualified if no leave had been taken.\n (e) An equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, conditions,  responsibilities, privileges, and status as the employee's original position.\n (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a geographically proximate worksite  from where the employee had previously been employed. If the employee's original worksite  has been closed, the employee is entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been  on leave when the worksite closed.\n (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the same shift or the same or an  equivalent work schedule.\n (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent opportunity for bonuses,  profit-sharing, and other similar discretionary and nondiscretionary payments.\n (4) This chapter does not prohibit an employer from accommodating an employee's  request to be restored to a different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the  employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a promotion to a better position.  However, an employee must not be induced by the employer to accept a different position  against the employee's wishes.\n (f) The requirement that an employee be restored to the same or equivalent job with the  same or equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not extend  to de minimis, intangible, or unmeasurable aspects of the job.\n Subd. 7.\nLimitations on an employee's right to reinstatement.\nAn employee has no  greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the  employee had been continuously employed during the period of leave under this chapter.  An employer must be able to show that an employee would not otherwise have been  employed at the time reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to employment.\n (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking a leave under this chapter and  employment is terminated, the employer's responsibility to continue the leave, maintain  group health plan benefits, and restore the employee cease at the time the employee is laid  off, provided the employer has no continuing obligations under a collective bargaining  agreement or otherwise. An employer has the burden of proving that an employee would  have been laid off during the period of leave under this chapter and, therefore, would not  be entitled to restoration to a job slated for layoff when the employee's original position  would not meet the requirements of an equivalent position.\n (2) If a shift has been eliminated or overtime has been decreased, an employee would  not be entitled to return to work that shift or the original overtime hours upon restoration.  However, if a position on, for example, a night shift has been filled by another employee,  the employee is entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before taking leave  under this chapter.\n (3) If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to perform work on a discrete  project, the employer has no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term or  project is over and the employer would not otherwise have continued to employ the employee.\n Subd. 8.\nRemedies.\n(a) In addition to any other remedies available to an employee in  law or equity, an employer who violates the provisions of this section is liable to any  employee affected for:\n (1) damages equal to the amount of:\n (i) any wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation denied or lost to such  employee by reason of the violation, or, in cases in which wages, salary, employment  benefits, or other compensation have not been denied or lost to the employee, any actual  monetary losses sustained by the employee as a direct result of the violation;\n (ii) reasonable interest on the amount described in item (i); and\n (iii) an additional amount as liquidated damages equal to the sum of the amount described  in item (i) and the interest described in item (ii), except that if an employer who has violated  the provisions of this section proves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission  which violated the provisions of this section was in good faith and that the employer had  reasonable grounds for believing that the act or omission was not a violation of the provisions  of this section, the court may, in the discretion of the court, reduce the amount of the liability  to the amount and interest determined under items (i) and (ii), respectively; and\n (2) such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including employment, reinstatement,  and promotion.\n (b) An action to recover damages or equitable relief prescribed in paragraph (a) may be  maintained against any employer in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction by  any one or more employees for and on behalf of:\n (1) the employees; or\n (2) the employees and other employees similarly situated.\n (c) The court in an action under this section must, in addition to any judgment awarded  to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow reasonable attorney fees, reasonable expert witness fees,  and other costs of the action to be paid by the defendant.\n (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow an employee to recover damages  from an employer for the denial of benefits under this chapter by the department, unless the  employer unlawfully interfered with the application for benefits under subdivision 2.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.10] SUBSTITUTION OF A PRIVATE PLAN.\n Subdivision 1.\nApplication for substitution.\nEmployers may apply to the commissioner  for approval to meet their obligations under this chapter through the substitution of a private  plan that provides paid family, paid medical, or paid family and medical benefits. In order  to be approved as meeting an employer's obligations under this chapter, a private plan must  confer all of the same rights, protections, and benefits provided to employees under this  chapter, including but not limited to benefits under section 268B.04 and employment  protections under section 268B.09. An employee covered by a private plan under this section  retains all applicable rights and remedies under section 268B.09.\n Subd. 2.\nPrivate plan requirements; medical benefit program.\nThe commissioner  must approve an application for private provision of the medical benefit program if the  commissioner determines:\n (1) all of the employees of the employer are to be covered under the provisions of the  employer plan;\n (2) eligibility requirements for benefits and leave are no more restrictive than as provided  under this chapter;\n (3) the weekly benefits payable under the private plan for any week are at least equal to  the weekly benefit amount payable under this chapter, taking into consideration any coverage  with respect to concurrent employment by another employer;\n (4) the total number of weeks for which benefits are payable under the private plan is  at least equal to the total number of weeks for which benefits would have been payable  under this chapter;\n (5) no greater amount is required to be paid by employees toward the cost of benefits  under the employer plan than by this chapter;\n (6) wage replacement benefits are stated in the plan separately and distinctly from other  benefits;\n (7) the private plan will provide benefits and leave for any serious health condition or  pregnancy for which benefits are payable, and leave provided, under this chapter;\n (8) the private plan will impose no additional condition or restriction on the use of  medical benefits beyond those explicitly authorized by this chapter or regulations  promulgated pursuant to this chapter;\n (9) the private plan will allow any employee covered under the private plan who is  eligible to receive medical benefits under this chapter to receive medical benefits under the  employer plan; and\n (10) coverage will continue under the private plan while an employee remains employed  by the employer.\n Subd. 3.\nPrivate plan requirements; family benefit program.\nThe commissioner must  approve an application for private provision of the family benefit program if the  commissioner determines:\n (1) all of the employees of the employer are to be covered under the provisions of the  employer plan;\n (2) eligibility requirements for benefits and leave are no more restrictive than as provided  under this chapter;\n (3) the weekly benefits payable under the private plan for any week are at least equal to  the weekly benefit amount payable under this chapter, taking into consideration any coverage  with respect to concurrent employment by another employer;\n (4) the total number of weeks for which benefits are payable under the private plan is  at least equal to the total number of weeks for which benefits would have been payable  under this chapter;\n (5) no greater amount is required to be paid by employees toward the cost of benefits  under the employer plan than by this chapter;\n (6) wage replacement benefits are stated in the plan separately and distinctly from other  benefits;\n (7) the private plan will provide benefits and leave for any care for a family member  with a serious health condition, bonding with a child, qualifying exigency, or safety leave  event for which benefits are payable, and leave provided, under this chapter;\n (8) the private plan will impose no additional condition or restriction on the use of family  benefits beyond those explicitly authorized by this chapter or regulations promulgated  pursuant to this chapter;\n (9) the private plan will allow any employee covered under the private plan who is  eligible to receive medical benefits under this chapter to receive medical benefits under the  employer plan; and\n (10) coverage will continue under the private plan while an employee remains employed  by the employer.\n Subd. 4.\nUse of private insurance products.\nNothing in this section prohibits an  employer from meeting the requirements of a private plan through a private insurance  product. If the employer plan involves a private insurance product, that insurance product  must conform to any applicable law or rule.\n Subd. 5.\nPrivate plan approval and oversight fee.\nAn employer with an approved  private plan is not required to pay premiums established under section 268B.14. An employer  with an approved private plan is responsible for a private plan approval and oversight fee  equal to $250 for employers with fewer than 50 employees, $500 for employers with 50 to  499 employees, and $1,000 for employers with 500 or more employees. The employer must  pay this fee (1) upon initial application for private plan approval, and (2) any time the  employer applies to amend the private plan. The commissioner must review and report on  the adequacy of this fee to cover private plan administrative costs annually beginning July  1, 2025, as part of the annual report established in section 268B.24.\n Subd. 6.\nPlan duration.\nA private plan under this section must be in effect for a period  of at least one year and, thereafter, continuously unless the commissioner finds that the  employer has given notice of withdrawal from the plan in a manner specified by the  commissioner in this section or rule. The plan may be withdrawn by the employer within  30 days of the effective date of any law increasing the benefit amounts or within 30 days  of the date of any change in the rate of premiums. If the plan is not withdrawn, it must be  amended to conform to provide the increased benefit amount or change in the rate of the  employee's premium on the date of the increase or change.\n Subd. 7.\nAppeals.\nAn employer may appeal any adverse action regarding that employer's  private plan to the commissioner, in a manner specified by the commissioner. An employee  covered under a private plan has the same right to appeal to the state under section 268B.04,  subdivision 7, as any other employee.\n Subd. 8.\nEmployees no longer covered.\n(a) An employee is no longer covered by an  approved private plan if a leave under this chapter occurs after the employment relationship  with the private plan employer ends, or if the commissioner revokes the approval of the  private plan.\n (b) An employee no longer covered by an approved private plan is, if otherwise eligible,  immediately entitled to benefits under this chapter to the same extent as though there had  been no approval of the private plan.\n Subd. 9.\nPosting of notice regarding private plan.\nAn employer with a private plan  must provide a notice prepared by or approved by the commissioner regarding the private  plan consistent with section 268B.26.\n Subd. 10.\nAmendment.\n(a) The commissioner must approve any amendment to a private  plan adjusting the provisions thereof, if the commissioner determines:\n (1) that the plan, as amended, will conform to the standards set forth in this chapter; and\n (2) that notice of the amendment has been delivered to all affected employees at least  ten days before the submission of the amendment.\n (b) Any amendments approved under this subdivision are effective on the date of the  commissioner's approval, unless the commissioner and the employer agree on a later date.\n Subd. 11.\nSuccessor employer.\nA private plan in effect at the time a successor acquires  the employer organization, trade, or business, or substantially all the assets thereof, or a  distinct and severable portion of the organization, trade, or business, and continues its  operation without substantial reduction of personnel resulting from the acquisition, must  continue the approved private plan and must not withdraw the plan without a specific request  for withdrawal in a manner and at a time specified by the commissioner. A successor may  terminate a private plan with notice to the commissioner and within 90 days from the date  of the acquisition.\n Subd. 12.\nRevocation of approval by commissioner.\n(a) The commissioner may  terminate any private plan if the commissioner determines the employer:\n (1) failed to pay benefits;\n (2) failed to pay benefits in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of this  chapter;\n (3) failed to submit reports as required by this chapter or rule adopted under this chapter;  or\n (4) otherwise failed to comply with this chapter or rule adopted under this chapter.\n (b) The commissioner must give notice of the intention to terminate a plan to the employer  at least ten days before taking any final action. The notice must state the effective date and  the reason for the termination.\n (c) The employer may, within ten days from mailing or personal service of the notice,  file an appeal to the commissioner in the time, manner, method, and procedure provided by  the commissioner under subdivision 7.\n (d) The payment of benefits must not be delayed during an employer's appeal of the  revocation of approval of a private plan.\n (e) If the commissioner revokes approval of an employer's private plan, that employer  is ineligible to apply for approval of another private plan for a period of three years, beginning  on the date of revocation.\n Subd. 13.\n Employer penalties.\n(a) The commissioner may assess the following monetary  penalties against an employer with an approved private plan found to have violated this  chapter:\n (1) $1,000 for the first violation; and\n (2) $2,000 for the second, and each successive violation.\n (b) The commissioner must waive collection of any penalty if the employer corrects the  violation within 30 days of receiving a notice of the violation and the notice is for a first  violation.\n (c) The commissioner may waive collection of any penalty if the commissioner determines  the violation to be an inadvertent error by the employer.\n (d) Monetary penalties collected under this section shall be deposited in the family and  medical benefit insurance account.\n (e) Assessment of penalties under this subdivision may be appealed as provided by the  commissioner under subdivision 7.\n Subd. 14.\nReports, information, and records.\nEmployers with an approved private  plan must maintain all reports, information, and records as relating to the private plan and  claims for a period of six years from creation and provide to the commissioner upon request.\n Subd. 15.\nAudit and investigation.\nThe commissioner may investigate and audit plans  approved under this section both before and after the plans are approved.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nThis section is effective January 1, 2024.\n[268B.11] SELF-EMPLOYED AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  ELECTION OF COVERAGE.\n Subdivision 1.\nElection of coverage.\n(a) A self-employed individual or independent  contractor may file with the commissioner by electronic transmission in a format prescribed  by the commissioner an application to be entitled to benefits under this chapter for a period  not less than 104 consecutive calendar weeks. Upon the approval of the commissioner, sent  by United States mail or electronic transmission, the individual is entitled to benefits under  this chapter beginning the calendar quarter after the date of approval or beginning in a later  calendar quarter if requested by the self-employed individual or independent contractor.  The individual ceases to be entitled to benefits as of the first day of January of any calendar  year only if, at least 30 calendar days before the first day of January, the individual has filed  with the commissioner by electronic transmission in a format prescribed by the commissioner  a notice to that effect.\n (b) The commissioner may terminate any application approved under this section with  30 calendar days' notice sent by United States mail or electronic transmission if the  self-employed individual is delinquent on any premiums due under this chapter. If an  approved application is terminated in this manner during the first 104 consecutive calendar  weeks of election, the self-employed individual remains obligated to pay the premium under  subdivision 3 for the remainder of that 104-week period.\n Subd. 2.\nApplication.\nA self-employed individual who applies for coverage under this  section must provide the commissioner with (1) the amount of the individual's net earnings  from self-employment, if any, from the two most recent taxable years and all tax documents  necessary to prove the accuracy of the amounts reported, and (2) any other documentation  the commissioner requires.

The commissioner has the discretion to accept wage detail reports that are  submitted by any other means or the commissioner may return the report submitted by other  than electronic transmission to the employer, and reports returned are considered as not  submitted and the late fees under subdivision 3 may be imposed.\n Subd. 3.\nFailure to timely file report; late fees.\n(a) Any employer that fails to submit  the quarterly wage detail report when due must pay a late fee of $10 per employee, computed  based upon the highest of:\n (1) the number of employees reported on the last wage detail report submitted;\n (2) the number of employees reported in the corresponding quarter of the prior calendar  year; or\n (3) if no wage detail report has ever been submitted, the number of employees listed at  the time of employer registration.\n The late fee is canceled if the wage detail report is received within 30 calendar days after  a demand for the report is sent to the employer by mail or electronic transmission. A late  fee assessed an employer may not be canceled more than twice each 12 months. The amount  of the late fee assessed may not be less than $250.\n (b) If the wage detail report is not received in a manner and format prescribed by the  commissioner within 30 calendar days after demand is sent under paragraph (a), the late  fee assessed under paragraph (a) doubles and a renewed demand notice and notice of the  increased late fee will be sent to the employer by mail or electronic transmission.\n (c) Late fees due under this subdivision may be canceled, in whole or in part, under  section 268B.16.\n Subd. 4.\nMissing or erroneous information.\n(a) Any employer that submits the wage  detail report, but fails to include all required employee information or enters erroneous  information, is subject to an administrative service fee of $25 for each employee for whom  the information is partially missing or erroneous.\n (b) Any employer that submits the wage detail report, but fails to include an employee,  is subject to an administrative service fee equal to two percent of the total wages for each  employee for whom the information is completely missing.\n Subd. 5.\nFees.\nThe fees provided for in subdivisions 3 and 4 are in addition to interest  and other penalties imposed by this chapter and are collected in the same manner as  delinquent taxes and credited to the family and medical benefit insurance account.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.13] EMPLOYER PREMIUM ACCOUNTS.\n The commissioner must maintain a premium account for each employer. The  commissioner must assess the premium account for all the premiums due under section  268B.14, and credit the family and medical benefit insurance account with all premiums  paid.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.14] PREMIUMS.\n Subdivision 1.\nPayments.\n(a) Family and medical leave premiums accrue and become  payable by each employer for each calendar year on the taxable wages that the employer  paid to employees in covered employment.\n Each employer must pay premiums quarterly, at the premium rate defined under this  section, on the taxable wages paid to each employee. The commissioner must compute the  premium due from the wage detail report required under section 268B.12 and notify the  employer of the premium due. The premiums must be paid to the family and medical benefit  insurance account and must be received by the department on or before the last day of the  month following the end of the calendar quarter.\n (b) If for any reason the wages on the wage detail report under section 268B.12 are  adjusted for any quarter, the commissioner must recompute the premiums due for that quarter  and assess the employer for any amount due or credit the employer as appropriate.\n Subd. 2.\nPayments by electronic payment required.\n(a) Every employer must make  any payments due under this chapter by electronic payment.\n (b) All third-party processors, paying on behalf of a client company, must make any  payments due under this chapter by electronic payment.\n (c) Regardless of paragraph (a) or (b), the commissioner has the discretion to accept  payment by other means.\n Subd. 3.\nEmployee charge back.\nNotwithstanding section 177.24, subdivision 4, or  181.06, subdivision 1, employers and covered business entities may deduct up to 50 percent  of annual premiums paid under this section from employee wages. Such deductions for any  given employee must be in equal proportion to the premiums paid based on the wages of  that employee, and all employees of an employer must be subject to the same percentage  deduction.

For the purposes of this section, \"levy\" includes  the power of distraint and seizure by any means.\n (b) In addition to a direct levy, the commissioner may issue a warrant to the sheriff of  any county who must proceed within 60 calendar days to levy upon the property or rights  to property of the delinquent person within the county, except property exempt under section  550.37. The sheriff must sell that property necessary to satisfy the total amount due, together  with the commissioner's and sheriff's costs. The sales are governed by the law applicable  to sales of like property on execution of a judgment.\n (c) Notice and demand for payment of the total amount due must be mailed to the  delinquent person at least ten calendar days before action being taken under paragraphs (a)  and (b).\n (d) If the commissioner has reason to believe that collection of the amount due is in  jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment may be made. If the total amount due  is not paid, the commissioner may proceed to collect by direct levy or issue a warrant without  regard to the ten calendar day period.\n (e) In executing the levy, the commissioner must have all of the powers provided in  chapter 550 or any other law that provides for execution against property in this state. The  sale of property levied upon and the time and manner of redemption is as provided in chapter  550. The seal of the court is not required. The levy may be made whether or not the  commissioner has commenced a legal action for collection.\n (f) Where any assessment has been made by the commissioner, the property seized for  collection of the total amount due must not be sold until any determination of liability has  become final. No sale may be made unless a portion of the amount due remains unpaid for  a period of more than 30 calendar days after the determination of liability becomes final.  Seized property may be sold at any time if:\n (1) the delinquent person consents in writing to the sale; or\n (2) the commissioner determines that the property is perishable or may become greatly  reduced in price or value by keeping, or that the property cannot be kept without great  expense.\n (g) Where a levy has been made to collect the amount due and the property seized is  properly included in a formal proceeding commenced under sections 524.3-401 to 524.3-505  and maintained under full supervision of the court, the property may not be sold until the  probate proceedings are completed or until the court orders.\n (h) The property seized must be returned if the owner:\n (1) gives a surety bond equal to the appraised value of the owner's interest in the property,  as determined by the commissioner; or\n (2) deposits with the commissioner security in a form and amount the commissioner  considers necessary to insure payment of the liability.\n (i) If a levy or sale would irreparably injure rights in property that the court determines  superior to rights of the state, the court may grant an injunction to prohibit the enforcement  of the levy or to prohibit the sale.\n (j) Any person who fails or refuses to surrender without reasonable cause any property  or rights to property subject to levy is personally liable in an amount equal to the value of  the property or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount due.\n (k) If the commissioner has seized the property of any individual, that individual may,  upon giving 48 hours notice to the commissioner and to the court, bring a claim for equitable  relief before the district court for the release of the property upon terms and conditions the  court considers equitable.\n (l) Any person in control or possession of property or rights to property upon which a  levy has been made who surrenders the property or rights to property, or who pays the  amount due is discharged from any obligation or liability to the person liable for the amount  due with respect to the property or rights to property.\n (m) The notice of any levy may be served personally or by mail.\n (n) The commissioner may release the levy upon all or part of the property or rights to  property levied upon if the commissioner determines that the release will facilitate the  collection of the liability, but the release does not prevent any subsequent levy. If the  commissioner determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, the commissioner  must return:\n (1) the specific property levied upon, at any time; or\n (2) an amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon, at any time before  the expiration of nine months from the date of levy.\n (o) Regardless of section 52.12, a levy upon a person's funds on deposit in a financial  institution located in this state, has priority over any unexercised right of setoff of the  financial institution to apply the levied funds toward the balance of an outstanding loan or  loans owed by the person to the financial institution. A claim by the financial institution  that it exercised its right to setoff before the levy must be substantiated by evidence of the  date of the setoff, and verified by an affidavit from a corporate officer of the financial  institution. For purposes of determining the priority of any levy under this subdivision, the  levy is treated as if it were an execution under chapter 550.\n Subd. 3.\nRight of setoff.\n(a) Upon certification by the commissioner to the commissioner  of management and budget, or to any state agency that disburses its own funds, that a person,  applicant, or employer has a liability under this chapter, and that the state has purchased  personal services, supplies, contract services, or property from that person, the commissioner  of management and budget or the state agency must set off and pay to the commissioner an  amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid liability from funds appropriated for payment of the  obligation of the state otherwise due the person. No amount may be set off from any funds  exempt under section 550.37 or funds due an individual who receives assistance under  chapter 256.\n (b) All funds, whether general or dedicated, are subject to setoff.\n (c) Regardless of any law to the contrary, the commissioner has first priority to setoff  from any funds otherwise due from the department to a delinquent person.\n Subd. 4.\nCollection by civil action.\n(a) Any amount due under this chapter, from an  applicant or employer, may be collected by civil action in the name of the state of Minnesota.  Civil actions brought under this subdivision must be heard as provided under section 16D.14.  In any action, judgment must be entered in default for the relief demanded in the complaint  without proof, together with costs and disbursements, upon the filing of an affidavit of  default.\n (b) Any person that is not a resident of this state and any resident person removed from  this state, is considered to appoint the secretary of state as its agent for the acceptance of  process in any civil action.
