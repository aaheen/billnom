The hearing shall be scheduled so that the parties have  adequate time to prepare and present arguments regarding the issue of sentence adjustment.  The parties may submit written arguments to the court prior to the date of the hearing and  may make oral arguments before the court at the hearing. The individual on whose behalf  the petition has been brought must be present at the hearing, unless excused under Minnesota  Rules of Criminal Procedure, rule 26.03, subdivision 1, clause (3).\n (b) A victim of the offense for which sentence adjustment is sought has a right to submit  an oral or written statement to the court at the time of the hearing describing the harm  suffered by the victim as a result of the crime and the victim's recommendation on whether  adjustment should be granted or denied.

In making this  determination, the court shall consider what impact, if any, a sentence adjustment would  have on public safety, including whether an adjustment would promote the rehabilitation  of the individual, properly reflect the severity of the underlying offense, or reduce sentencing  disparities. In making this determination, the court may consider factors relating to both the  offender and the offense, including but not limited to:\n (1) the individual's performance on probation or supervision;\n (2) the individual's disciplinary record during any period of incarceration;\n (3) records of any rehabilitation efforts made by the individual since the date of offense  and any plan to continue those efforts in the community;\n (4) evidence that remorse, age, diminished physical condition, or any other factor has  significantly reduced the likelihood that the individual will commit a future offense;\n (5) the amount of time the individual has served in custody or under supervision; and\n (6) significant changes in law or sentencing practice since the date of offense.\n (b) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if the court determines that there are  substantial and compelling reasons to adjust the individual's sentence, the court may modify  the sentence in any way provided the adjustment does not:\n (1) increase the period of confinement or, if the individual is serving a stayed sentence,  increase the period of supervision;\n (2) reduce or eliminate the amount of court-ordered restitution; or\n (3) reduce or eliminate a term of conditional release required by law when a court  commits an offender to the custody of the commissioner of corrections.\n The court may stay imposition or execution of sentence pursuant to section 609.135.\n (c) A sentence adjustment is not a valid basis to vacate the judgment of conviction, enter  a judgment of conviction for a different offense, or impose sentence for any other offense.\n (d) The court shall state in writing or on the record the reasons for its decision on the  petition. If the court grants a sentence adjustment, the court shall complete and forward a  sentencing worksheet as provided in section 609.115, subdivision 1, to the Sentencing  Guidelines Commission. The sentencing worksheet shall clearly indicate that it is for a  sentence adjustment.\n Subd. 8.\nAppeals.\nAn order issued under this section shall not be considered a final  judgment, but shall be treated as an order imposing or staying a sentence.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nThis section is effective August 1, 2023.\n"

This plan must specify the  total amount of money the facility is estimated to receive from this rate increase and how  that money will be distributed to increase the allowable compensation-related costs described  in paragraph (d) for employees described in paragraphs (b) and (c). This estimate must be  calculated by multiplying $52 and the sum of the medical assistance and private pay resident  days as defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 256R.02, subdivision 45, for the period  beginning October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022, dividing this sum by 365 and  multiplying the result by 915.

The distribution plan summary must include instructions  regarding how to contact the commissioner, or the commissioner's representative, if an  employee believes the employee is covered by paragraph (b) or (c) and has not received the  compensation-related increases described in paragraph (d).

The posted distribution plan summary must  demonstrate how the increase in paragraph (a) received by the nursing facility from July 1,  2023, through December 31, 2025, will be used in full to pay the compensation-related costs  in paragraph (d) for employees described in paragraphs (b) and (c). \n (g) If the nursing facility expends less on new compensation-related costs than the amount  made available by the rate increase in this section for that purpose, the amount of this rate  adjustment must be reduced to equal the amount utilized by the facility for purposes  authorized under this section. If the facility fails to post the distribution plan summary in  its facility as required, fails to submit its distribution plan to the commissioner by the due  date, or uses these funds for unauthorized purposes, these rate increases must be treated as  an overpayment and subsequently recovered.\n (h) The commissioner must not treat payments received under this section as an applicable  credit for purposes of setting total payment rates under Minnesota Statutes, chapter 256R.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nThis section is effective July 1, 2023, or upon federal approval,  whichever is later.

If the applicant does not meet eligibility at the time of the application or fails to provide all  requested information, the communication is not an application for family and medical leave  benefits.\n (b) The commissioner must examine each application for benefits to determine the base  period and the benefit year, and based upon all the covered employment in the base period  the commissioner must determine the weekly benefit amount available, if any, and the  maximum amount of benefits available, if any. The determination, which is a document  separate and distinct from a document titled a determination of eligibility or determination  of ineligibility, must be titled determination of benefit account. A determination of benefit  account must be sent to the applicant and all base period employers, by mail or electronic  transmission.\n (c) If a base period employer did not provide wage detail information for the applicant  as required under section 268B.12, the commissioner may accept an applicant certification  of wage credits, based upon the applicant's records, and issue a determination of benefit  account.\n (d) The commissioner may, at any time within 24 months from the establishment of a  benefit account, reconsider any determination of benefit account and make an amended  determination if the commissioner finds that the wage credits listed in the determination  were incorrect for any reason. An amended determination of benefit account must be  promptly sent to the applicant and all base period employers, by mail or electronic  transmission. This paragraph does not apply to documents titled determinations of eligibility  or determinations of ineligibility issued.\n (e) If an amended determination of benefit account reduces the weekly benefit amount  or maximum amount of benefits available, any benefits that have been paid greater than the  applicant was entitled is an overpayment of benefits. A determination or amended  determination issued under this section that results in an overpayment of benefits must set  out the amount of the overpayment and the requirement that the overpaid benefits must be  repaid according to section 268B.185.\n Subd. 2.\nBenefit account requirements.\nTo establish a benefit account, an applicant  must have wage credits of at least 5.3 percent of the state's average annual wage rounded  down to the next lower $100.\n Subd. 3.\nWeekly benefit amount; maximum amount of benefits available; prorated  amount.\n(a) Subject to the maximum weekly benefit amount, an applicant's weekly benefit  is calculated by adding the amounts obtained by applying the following percentage to an  applicant's average typical workweek and weekly wage during the high quarter of the base  period:\n (1) 90 percent of wages that do not exceed 50 percent of the state's average weekly wage;  plus\n (2) 66 percent of wages that exceed 50 percent of the state's average weekly wage but  not 100 percent; plus\n (3) 55 percent of wages that exceed 100 percent of the state's average weekly wage.\n (b) The state's average weekly wage is the average wage as calculated under section  268.035, subdivision 23, at the time a benefit amount is first determined.\n (c) The maximum weekly benefit amount is the state's average weekly wage as calculated  under section 268.035, subdivision 23.\n (d) The state's maximum weekly benefit amount, computed in accordance with section  268.035, subdivision 23, applies to a benefit account established effective on or after the  last Sunday in October. Once established, an applicant's weekly benefit amount is not  affected by the last Sunday in October change in the state's maximum weekly benefit amount.\n (e) For an employee receiving family or medical leave, a weekly benefit amount is  prorated when:\n (1) the employee works hours for wages; or\n (2) the employee uses paid sick leave, paid vacation leave, or other paid time off that is  not considered a supplemental benefit payment as defined in section 268B.01, subdivision  37.\n Subd. 4.\nTiming of payment.\nExcept as otherwise provided for in this chapter, benefits  must be paid weekly.\n Subd. 5.\nMaximum length of benefits.\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), in a  single benefit year, an applicant may receive up to 12 weeks of benefits under this chapter  related to the applicant's serious health condition or pregnancy and up to 12 weeks of benefits  under this chapter for bonding, safety leave, or family care.\n (b) An applicant may receive up to 12 weeks of benefits in a single benefit year for leave  related to one or more qualifying exigencies.\n Subd. 6.\nMinimum period for which benefits payable.\nExcept for a claim for benefits  for bonding leave, any claim for benefits must be based on a single qualifying event of at  least seven calendar days. Benefits may be paid for a minimum duration of eight consecutive  hours in a week. If an applicant on leave claims eight hours at any point during a week, the  minimum duration is satisfied.\n Subd. 7.\nRight of appeal.\n(a) A determination or amended determination of benefit  account is final unless an appeal is filed by the applicant within 60 calendar days after the  sending of the determination or amended determination.\n (b) Any applicant may appeal from a determination or amended determination of benefit  account on the issue of whether services performed constitute employment, whether the  employment is covered employment, and whether money paid constitutes wages.\n Subd. 8.\nLimitations on applications and benefit accounts.\n(a) An application for  family or medical leave benefits is effective the Sunday of the calendar week that the  application was filed. An application for benefits may be backdated one calendar week  before the Sunday of the week the application was actually filed if the applicant requests  the backdating within seven calendar days of the date the application is filed. An application  may be backdated only if the applicant was eligible for the benefit during the period of the  backdating. If an individual attempted to file an application for benefits, but was prevented  from filing an application by the department, the application is effective the Sunday of the  calendar week the individual first attempted to file an application.\n (b) A benefit account established under subdivision 2 is effective the date the application  for benefits was effective.\n (c) A benefit account, once established, may later be withdrawn if:\n (1) the applicant has not been paid any benefits on that benefit account; and\n (2) a new application for benefits is filed and a new benefit account is established at the  time of the withdrawal.\n (d) A benefit account may be withdrawn after the expiration of the benefit year if the  applicant was not paid any benefits on the benefit account that is being withdrawn.\n (e) A determination or amended determination of eligibility or ineligibility issued under  section 268B.07 that was sent before the withdrawal of the benefit account, remains in effect  and is not voided by the withdrawal of the benefit account.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.05] NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES.\n An applicant shall promptly notify the department of changes that may affect eligibility  under section 268B.06.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.06] ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS; PAYMENTS THAT AFFECT  BENEFITS.\n Subdivision 1.\nEligibility conditions.\n(a) An applicant may be eligible to receive family  or medical leave benefits for any week if:\n (1) the week for which benefits are requested is in the applicant's benefit year;\n (2) the applicant was unable to perform regular work due to a serious health condition,  a qualifying exigency, safety leave, family care, bonding, pregnancy, or recovery from  pregnancy for the period required under subdivision 2.

A determination or amended  determination issued under this section that results in an overpayment of benefits must set  out the amount of the overpayment and the requirement that the overpaid benefits must be  repaid according to section 268B.185.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.08] APPEAL PROCESS.\n Subdivision 1.\nHearing.\n(a) The commissioner shall designate a chief benefit judge.\n (b) Upon a timely appeal to a determination having been filed or upon a referral for  direct hearing, the chief benefit judge must set a time and date for a de novo due-process  hearing and send notice to an applicant and an employer, by mail or electronic transmission,  not less than ten calendar days before the date of the hearing.\n (c) The commissioner may adopt rules on procedures for hearings.

If 30 days' notice is not practicable because of a lack of knowledge of approximately  when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, or a medical emergency,  notice must be given as soon as practicable. Whether leave is to be continuous or is to be  taken intermittently or on a reduced-schedule basis, notice need only be given one time, but  the employee must advise the employer as soon as practicable if dates of scheduled leave  change or are extended, or were initially unknown. In those cases where the employee is  required to provide at least 30 days' notice of foreseeable leave and does not do so, the  employee must explain the reasons why notice was not practicable upon request from the  employer.\n (b) \"As soon as practicable\" means as soon as both possible and practical, taking into  account all of the facts and circumstances in the individual case. When an employee becomes  aware of a need for leave under this chapter less than 30 days in advance, it should be  practicable for the employee to provide notice of the need for leave either the same day or  the next day, unless the need for leave is based on a medical emergency. In all cases,  however, the determination of when an employee could practicably provide notice must  take into account the individual facts and circumstances.\n (c) An employee shall provide at least oral, telephone, or text message notice sufficient  to make the employer aware that the employee needs leave allowed under this chapter and  the anticipated timing and duration of the leave.\n (d) An employer may require an employee to comply with the employer's usual and  customary notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual  circumstances or other circumstances caused by the reason for the employee's need for  leave. Leave under this chapter must not be delayed or denied where an employer's usual  and customary notice or procedural requirements require notice to be given sooner than set  forth in this subdivision.\n (e) If an employer has failed to provide notice to the employee as required under section  268B.26, paragraph (a), (b), or (e), the employee is not required to comply with the notice  requirements of this subdivision.\n Subd. 3.\nBonding leave.\nBonding leave taken under this chapter begins at a time requested  by the employee. Bonding leave must end within 12 months of the birth, adoption, or  placement of a foster child, except that, in the case where the child must remain in the  hospital longer than the mother, the leave must end within 12 months after the child leaves  the hospital.\n Subd. 4.\nIntermittent or reduced-leave schedule.\n(a) Leave under this chapter, based  on a serious health condition, may be taken intermittently or on a reduced-leave schedule  if such leave is reasonable and appropriate to the needs of the individual with the serious  health condition. For all other leaves under this chapter, leave may be taken intermittently  or on a reduced-leave schedule. Intermittent leave is leave taken in separate blocks of time  due to a single, seven-day qualifying event. A reduced-leave schedule is a leave schedule  that reduces an employee's usual number of working hours per workweek or hours per  workday.\n (b) Leave taken intermittently or on a reduced-schedule basis counts toward the  maximums described in section 268B.04, subdivision 5.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.09] EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS.\n Subdivision 1.\nRetaliation prohibited.\nAn employer must not retaliate against an  employee for requesting or obtaining benefits or leave, or for exercising any other right  under this chapter.\n Subd. 2.\nInterference prohibited.\nAn employer must not obstruct or impede an  application for leave or benefits or the exercise of any other right under this chapter.\n Subd. 3.\nWaiver of rights void.\nAny agreement to waive, release, or commute rights  to benefits or any other right under this chapter is void.\n Subd. 4.\nNo assignment of benefits.\nAny assignment, pledge, or encumbrance of benefits  is void. Benefits are exempt from levy, execution, attachment, or any other remedy provided  for the collection of debt. Any waiver of this subdivision is void.\n Subd. 5.\nContinued insurance.\nDuring any leave for which an employee is entitled to  benefits under this chapter, the employer must maintain coverage under any group insurance  policy, group subscriber contract, or health care plan for the employee and any dependents  as if the employee was not on leave, provided, however, that the employee must continue  to pay any employee share of the cost of such benefits.\n Subd. 6.\nEmployee right to reinstatement.\n(a) On return from leave under this chapter,  an employee is entitled to be returned to the same position the employee held when leave  commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and  conditions of employment. An employee is entitled to reinstatement even if the employee  has been replaced or the employee's position has been restructured to accommodate the  employee's absence.\n (b)(1) An equivalent position is one that is virtually identical to the employee's former  position in terms of pay, benefits, and working conditions, including privileges, prerequisites,  and status. It must involve the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities,  which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility, and authority.\n (2) If an employee is no longer qualified for the position because of the employee's  inability to attend a necessary course, renew a license, fly a minimum number of hours, or  similar condition, as a result of the leave, the employee must be given a reasonable  opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon return from leave.\n (c)(1) An employee is entitled to any unconditional pay increases which may have  occurred during the leave period, such as cost of living increases. Pay increases conditioned  upon seniority, length of service, or work performed must be granted in accordance with  the employer's policy or practice with respect to other employees on an equivalent leave  status for a reason that does not qualify for leave under this chapter. An employee is entitled  to be restored to a position with the same or equivalent pay premiums, such as a shift  differential. If an employee departed from a position averaging ten hours of overtime, and  corresponding overtime pay, each week an employee is ordinarily entitled to such a position  on return from leave under this chapter.\n (2) Equivalent pay includes any bonus or payment, whether it is discretionary or  nondiscretionary, made to employees consistent with clause (1). If a bonus or other payment  is based on the achievement of a specified goal such as hours worked, products sold, or  perfect attendance, and the employee has not met the goal due to leave under this chapter,  the payment may be denied, unless otherwise paid to employees on an equivalent leave  status for a reason that does not qualify for leave under this chapter.\n (d) Benefits under this section include all benefits provided or made available to  employees by an employer, including group life insurance, health insurance, disability  insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether  benefits are provided by a practice or written policy of an employer through an employee  benefit plan as defined in section 3(3) of United States Code, title 29, section 1002(3).\n (1) At the end of an employee's leave under this chapter, benefits must be resumed in  the same manner and at the same levels as provided when the leave began, and subject to  any changes in benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of leave affecting  the entire workforce, unless otherwise elected by the employee. Upon return from a leave  under this chapter, an employee must not be required to requalify for any benefits the  employee enjoyed before leave began, including family or dependent coverages.\n (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any additional benefits or seniority  during a leave under this chapter. Benefits accrued at the time leave began must be available  to an employee upon return from leave.\n (3) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, leave under this chapter must  not be treated as or counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and eligibility  to participate. If the plan requires an employee to be employed on a specific date in order  to be credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions, or participation purposes,  an employee on leave under this chapter must be treated as employed on that date. Periods  of leave under this chapter need not be treated as credited service for purposes of benefit  accrual, vesting, and eligibility to participate.\n (4) Employees on leave under this chapter must be treated as if they continued to work  for purposes of changes to benefit plans. Employees on leave under this chapter are entitled  to changes in benefit plans, except those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual  during the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to the same extent they  would have qualified if no leave had been taken.\n (e) An equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, conditions,  responsibilities, privileges, and status as the employee's original position.\n (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a geographically proximate worksite  from where the employee had previously been employed. If the employee's original worksite  has been closed, the employee is entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been  on leave when the worksite closed.\n (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the same shift or the same or an  equivalent work schedule.\n (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent opportunity for bonuses,  profit-sharing, and other similar discretionary and nondiscretionary payments.\n (4) This chapter does not prohibit an employer from accommodating an employee's  request to be restored to a different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the  employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a promotion to a better position.  However, an employee must not be induced by the employer to accept a different position  against the employee's wishes.\n (f) The requirement that an employee be restored to the same or equivalent job with the  same or equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of employment does not extend  to de minimis, intangible, or unmeasurable aspects of the job.\n Subd. 7.\nLimitations on an employee's right to reinstatement.\nAn employee has no  greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the  employee had been continuously employed during the period of leave under this chapter.  An employer must be able to show that an employee would not otherwise have been  employed at the time reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to employment.\n (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking a leave under this chapter and  employment is terminated, the employer's responsibility to continue the leave, maintain  group health plan benefits, and restore the employee cease at the time the employee is laid  off, provided the employer has no continuing obligations under a collective bargaining  agreement or otherwise. An employer has the burden of proving that an employee would  have been laid off during the period of leave under this chapter and, therefore, would not  be entitled to restoration to a job slated for layoff when the employee's original position  would not meet the requirements of an equivalent position.\n (2) If a shift has been eliminated or overtime has been decreased, an employee would  not be entitled to return to work that shift or the original overtime hours upon restoration.

For the purposes of this section, \"date of  assessment\" means the date the obligation was due.\n (b) The lien is not enforceable against any purchaser, mortgagee, pledgee, holder of a  Uniform Commercial Code security interest, mechanic's lien, or judgment lien creditor,  until a notice of lien has been filed with the county recorder of the county where the property  is situated, or in the case of personal property belonging to a nonresident person in the Office  of the Secretary of State. When the notice of lien is filed with the county recorder, the fee  for filing and indexing is as provided in sections 272.483 and 272.484.\n (c) Notices of liens, lien renewals, and lien releases, in a form prescribed by the  commissioner, may be filed with the county recorder or the secretary of state by mail,  personal delivery, or electronic transmission into the computerized filing system of the  secretary of state. The secretary of state must, on any notice filed with that office, transmit  the notice electronically to the appropriate county recorder.

For notices filed  electronically with the county recorders, the date and time of receipt of the notice and county  recorder's file number, and for notices filed electronically with the secretary of state, the  secretary of state's recording information, must be entered into the central database before  the close of the working day following the day of the original data entry by the commissioner.\n (e) The lien imposed on personal property, even though properly filed, is not enforceable  against a purchaser of tangible personal property purchased at retail or personal property  listed as exempt in sections 550.37, 550.38, and 550.39.\n (f) A notice of lien filed has priority over any security interest arising under chapter 336,  article 9, that is perfected prior in time to the lien imposed by this subdivision, but only if:\n (1) the perfected security interest secures property not in existence at the time the notice  of lien is filed; and\n (2) the property comes into existence after the 45th calendar day following the day the  notice of lien is filed, or after the secured party has actual notice or knowledge of the lien  filing, whichever is earlier.\n (g) The lien is enforceable from the time the lien arises and for ten years from the date  of filing the notice of lien. A notice of lien may be renewed before expiration for an additional  ten years.\n (h) The lien is enforceable by levy under subdivision 2 or by judgment lien foreclosure  under chapter 550.\n (i) The lien may be imposed upon property defined as homestead property in chapter  510 but may be enforced only upon the sale, transfer, or conveyance of the homestead  property.\n (j) The commissioner may sell and assign to a third party the commissioner's right of  redemption in specific real property for liens filed under this subdivision.

Any proceeds from  the sale of the right of redemption are credited to the family and medical benefit insurance  account.\n Subd. 2.\nLevy.\n(a) If any amount due under this chapter, from an applicant or an employer,  is not paid when due, the amount may be collected by the commissioner by direct levy upon  all property and rights of property of the person liable for the amount due except property  exempt from execution under section 550.37. For the purposes of this section, \"levy\" includes  the power of distraint and seizure by any means.\n (b) In addition to a direct levy, the commissioner may issue a warrant to the sheriff of  any county who must proceed within 60 calendar days to levy upon the property or rights  to property of the delinquent person within the county, except property exempt under section  550.37. The sheriff must sell that property necessary to satisfy the total amount due, together  with the commissioner's and sheriff's costs. The sales are governed by the law applicable  to sales of like property on execution of a judgment.\n (c) Notice and demand for payment of the total amount due must be mailed to the  delinquent person at least ten calendar days before action being taken under paragraphs (a)  and (b).\n (d) If the commissioner has reason to believe that collection of the amount due is in  jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment may be made. If the total amount due  is not paid, the commissioner may proceed to collect by direct levy or issue a warrant without  regard to the ten calendar day period.\n (e) In executing the levy, the commissioner must have all of the powers provided in  chapter 550 or any other law that provides for execution against property in this state. The  sale of property levied upon and the time and manner of redemption is as provided in chapter  550. The seal of the court is not required. The levy may be made whether or not the  commissioner has commenced a legal action for collection.\n (f) Where any assessment has been made by the commissioner, the property seized for  collection of the total amount due must not be sold until any determination of liability has  become final. No sale may be made unless a portion of the amount due remains unpaid for  a period of more than 30 calendar days after the determination of liability becomes final.  Seized property may be sold at any time if:\n (1) the delinquent person consents in writing to the sale; or\n (2) the commissioner determines that the property is perishable or may become greatly  reduced in price or value by keeping, or that the property cannot be kept without great  expense.\n (g) Where a levy has been made to collect the amount due and the property seized is  properly included in a formal proceeding commenced under sections 524.3-401 to 524.3-505  and maintained under full supervision of the court, the property may not be sold until the  probate proceedings are completed or until the court orders.\n (h) The property seized must be returned if the owner:\n (1) gives a surety bond equal to the appraised value of the owner's interest in the property,  as determined by the commissioner; or\n (2) deposits with the commissioner security in a form and amount the commissioner  considers necessary to insure payment of the liability.\n (i) If a levy or sale would irreparably injure rights in property that the court determines  superior to rights of the state, the court may grant an injunction to prohibit the enforcement  of the levy or to prohibit the sale.\n (j) Any person who fails or refuses to surrender without reasonable cause any property  or rights to property subject to levy is personally liable in an amount equal to the value of  the property or rights not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount due.\n (k) If the commissioner has seized the property of any individual, that individual may,  upon giving 48 hours notice to the commissioner and to the court, bring a claim for equitable  relief before the district court for the release of the property upon terms and conditions the  court considers equitable.\n (l) Any person in control or possession of property or rights to property upon which a  levy has been made who surrenders the property or rights to property, or who pays the  amount due is discharged from any obligation or liability to the person liable for the amount  due with respect to the property or rights to property.\n (m) The notice of any levy may be served personally or by mail.\n (n) The commissioner may release the levy upon all or part of the property or rights to  property levied upon if the commissioner determines that the release will facilitate the  collection of the liability, but the release does not prevent any subsequent levy. If the  commissioner determines that property has been wrongfully levied upon, the commissioner  must return:\n (1) the specific property levied upon, at any time; or\n (2) an amount of money equal to the amount of money levied upon, at any time before  the expiration of nine months from the date of levy.\n (o) Regardless of section 52.12, a levy upon a person's funds on deposit in a financial  institution located in this state, has priority over any unexercised right of setoff of the  financial institution to apply the levied funds toward the balance of an outstanding loan or  loans owed by the person to the financial institution. A claim by the financial institution  that it exercised its right to setoff before the levy must be substantiated by evidence of the  date of the setoff, and verified by an affidavit from a corporate officer of the financial  institution. For purposes of determining the priority of any levy under this subdivision, the  levy is treated as if it were an execution under chapter 550.\n Subd. 3.\nRight of setoff.\n(a) Upon certification by the commissioner to the commissioner  of management and budget, or to any state agency that disburses its own funds, that a person,  applicant, or employer has a liability under this chapter, and that the state has purchased  personal services, supplies, contract services, or property from that person, the commissioner  of management and budget or the state agency must set off and pay to the commissioner an  amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid liability from funds appropriated for payment of the  obligation of the state otherwise due the person. No amount may be set off from any funds  exempt under section 550.37 or funds due an individual who receives assistance under  chapter 256.\n (b) All funds, whether general or dedicated, are subject to setoff.\n (c) Regardless of any law to the contrary, the commissioner has first priority to setoff  from any funds otherwise due from the department to a delinquent person.\n Subd. 4.\nCollection by civil action.\n(a) Any amount due under this chapter, from an  applicant or employer, may be collected by civil action in the name of the state of Minnesota.  Civil actions brought under this subdivision must be heard as provided under section 16D.14.  In any action, judgment must be entered in default for the relief demanded in the complaint  without proof, together with costs and disbursements, upon the filing of an affidavit of  default.\n (b) Any person that is not a resident of this state and any resident person removed from  this state, is considered to appoint the secretary of state as its agent for the acceptance of  process in any civil action. The commissioner must file process with the secretary of state,  together with a payment of a fee of $15 and that service is considered sufficient service and  has the same force and validity as if served personally within this state. Notice of the service  of process, together with a copy of the process, must be sent by certified mail to the person's  last known address. An affidavit of compliance with this subdivision, and a copy of the  notice of service must be appended to the original of the process and filed in the court.\n (c) No court filing fees, docketing fees, or release of judgment fees may be assessed  against the state for actions under this subdivision.\n Subd. 5.\nInjunction forbidden.\nNo injunction or other legal action to prevent the  determination, assessment, or collection of any amounts due under this chapter, from an  applicant or employer, are allowed.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.24] CONCILIATION SERVICES.\n The Department of Labor and Industry may offer conciliation services to employers and  employees to resolve disputes concerning alleged violations of employment protections  identified in section 268B.09.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.25] ANNUAL REPORTS.\n (a) Beginning on or before July 1, 2026, the commissioner must annually report to the  Department of Management and Budget and the house of representatives and senate  committee chairs with jurisdiction over this chapter on program administrative expenditures  and revenue collection for the prior fiscal year, including but not limited to:\n (1) total revenue raised through premium collection;\n (2) the number of self-employed individuals or independent contractors electing coverage  under section 268B.11 and amount of associated revenue;\n (3) the number of covered business entities paying premiums under this chapter and  associated revenue;\n (4) administrative expenditures including transfers to other state agencies expended in  the administration of the chapter;\n (5) summary of contracted services expended in the administration of this chapter;\n (6) grant amounts and recipients under sections 268B.18 and 268B.29;\n (7) an accounting of required outreach expenditures;\n (8) summary of private plan approvals including the number of employers and employees  covered under private plans; and\n (9) adequacy and use of the private plan approval and oversight fee.\n (b) Beginning on or before July 1, 2026, the commissioner must annually publish a  publicly available report providing the following information for the previous fiscal year:\n (1) total eligible claims;\n (2) the number and percentage of claims attributable to each category of benefit;\n (3) claimant demographics by age, gender, average weekly wage, occupation, and the  type of leave taken;\n (4) the percentage of claims denied and the reasons therefor, including but not limited  to insufficient information and ineligibility and the reason therefor;\n (5) average weekly benefit amount paid for all claims and by category of benefit;\n (6) changes in the benefits paid compared to previous fiscal years;\n (7) processing times for initial claims processing, initial determinations, and final  decisions;\n (8) average duration for cases completed; and\n (9) the number of cases remaining open at the close of such year.\n EFFECTIVE DATE.\nExcept as provided in section 38, this section is effective July 1,  2025.\n[268B.26] NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.\n (a) Each employer must post in a conspicuous place on each of its premises a workplace  notice prepared or approved by the commissioner providing notice of benefits available  under this chapter.

If a person who is not entitled to  vote becomes registered to vote pursuant to this section and votes or attempts to vote in an  election held after the effective date of the person's registration, that person is presumed to  have a defense. This subdivision shall not apply to a person who knowingly and willfully  makes a false statement to effectuate voter registration or who intentionally takes voluntary  action to register to vote or vote knowing that the person is not entitled to vote.\n Subd. 9.\nEffective date of registration.\nUnless the applicant declines registration, the  effective date of the registration is 20 days after the date of qualifying application under  subdivision 1.
