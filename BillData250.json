The court administrator, the sheriff of any county in this state,  and other law enforcement and corrections officers shall perform their duties relating to  service of process without charge to the petitioner. The court shall direct payment of the  reasonable costs of service of process if served by a private process server when the sheriff  or other law enforcement or corrections officer is unavailable or if service is made by  publication, without requiring the petitioner to make application under section 563.01.\n (i) The court shall advise the petitioner of the right to serve the respondent by alternate  notice under section 624.7172, subdivision 1, paragraph (e), if the respondent is avoiding  personal service by concealment or otherwise, and shall assist in the writing and filing of  the affidavit.\n (j) The court shall advise the petitioner of the right to request a hearing under section  624.7174, paragraph (c).

The court shall order service by first class mail, forwarding address requested,  to any addresses where there is a reasonable possibility that mail or information will be  forwarded or communicated to the respondent. The court may also order publication, within  or without the state, but only if it might reasonably succeed in notifying the respondent of  the proceeding. Service shall be deemed complete 14 days after mailing or 14 days after  court-ordered publication.\n Subd. 2.\nRelief by court.\n(a) At the hearing, the petitioner must prove by a preponderance  of the evidence that the respondent poses a significant danger of bodily harm to self or other  persons by possessing a firearm.\n (b) In determining whether to grant the order after a hearing, the court shall consider  evidence of the following, whether or not the petitioner has provided evidence of the same:\n (1) a history of threats or acts of violence by the respondent directed toward another  person;\n (2) the history of use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force by the respondent  against another person;\n (3) a violation of any court order, including but not limited to orders issued under sections  624.7171 to 624.7178 or chapter 260C or 518B;\n (4) a prior arrest for a felony offense;\n (5) a conviction or prior arrest for a violent misdemeanor offense, for a stalking offense  under section 609.749, or for domestic assault under section 609.2242;\n (6) a conviction for an offense of cruelty to animals under chapter 343;\n (7) the unlawful and reckless use, display, or brandishing of a firearm by the respondent;\n (8) a history of self-harm by the respondent; and\n (9) whether the respondent is named in an existing order in effect under sections 624.7171  to 624.7178 or chapter 260C or 518B, or party to a pending lawsuit, complaint, petition, or  other action under sections 624.7171 to 624.7178 or chapter 518B.\n (c) In determining whether to grant the order after a hearing, the court may consider any  other evidence that bears on whether the respondent poses a danger to the respondent's self  or others.\n (d) If the court finds there is a preponderance of the evidence to issue an extreme risk  protection order, the court shall issue the order prohibiting the person from possessing a  firearm for the duration of the order. The court shall inform the respondent that the respondent  is prohibited from possessing firearms and shall issue a transfer order under section 624.7175.  The court shall also give notice to the county attorney's office, which may take action as it  deems appropriate.\n (e) The order shall have a fixed period, to be determined by the court, of not less than  six months and not more than two years, subject to renewal or extension under section  624.7173.\n (f) If there is no existing emergency order under section 624.7174 at the time an order  is granted under this section, the court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence  whether the respondent presents an immediate and present danger of bodily harm. If the  court so determines, the transfer order shall include the provisions described in section  624.7175, paragraph (c).\n (g) If, after a hearing, the court does not issue an order of protection, the court shall  vacate any emergency extreme risk protection order currently in effect.\n (h) A respondent may waive the respondent's right to contest the hearing and consent  to the court's imposition of an extreme risk protection order. The court shall seal the petition  filed under this section and section 624.7144 if a respondent who consents to imposition of  an extreme risk protection order requests that the petition be sealed, unless the court finds  that there is clear and convincing evidence that the interests of the public and public safety  outweigh the disadvantages to the respondent of not sealing the petition. All extreme risk  protection orders shall remain public.\n[624.7173] SUBSEQUENT EXTENSIONS AND TERMINATION.\n (a) Upon application by any party entitled to petition for an order under section 624.7172,  and after notice to the respondent and a hearing, the court may extend the relief granted in  an existing order granted after a hearing under section 624.7172. Application for an extension  may be made any time within the three months before the expiration of the existing order.  The order may be extended for a fixed period of at least six months and not to exceed two  years, if the court makes the same findings by a preponderance of the evidence as required  for granting of an initial order under section 624.7172, subdivision 2, paragraph (d). The  court shall consider the same types of evidence as required for the initial order under section  624.7172, subdivision 2, paragraphs (b) and (c).\n (b) Upon application by the respondent to an order issued under section 624.7172, the  court may terminate an order after a hearing at which the respondent shall bear the burden  of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent does not pose a significant  danger of bodily harm to the respondent's self or to other persons by possessing a firearm.  Application for termination may be made one time for each year an order is in effect. If an  order has been issued for a period of six months, the respondent may apply for termination  one time.\n[624.7174] EMERGENCY ISSUANCE OF EXTREME RISK PROTECTION  ORDER.\n (a) In determining whether to grant an emergency extreme risk protection order, the  court shall consider evidence of all facts identified in section 624.7172, subdivision 2,  paragraphs (b) and (c).\n (b) The court shall advise the petitioner of the right to request an order after a hearing  under section 624.7172 separately from or simultaneously with the petition.\n (c) If the court finds there is reasonable grounds that (1) the respondent poses a significant  danger of bodily harm to the respondent's self or to other persons by possessing a firearm,  and (2) the respondent presents an immediate and present danger of bodily harm, the court  shall issue an ex parte emergency order prohibiting the respondent from possessing a firearm  for the duration of the order. The order shall inform the respondent that the respondent is  prohibited from possessing firearms and shall issue a transfer order under section 624.7175,  paragraph (c).\n (d) A finding by the court that there is a basis for issuing an emergency extreme risk  protection order constitutes a finding that sufficient reasons exist not to require notice under  applicable court rules governing applications for ex parte relief.\n (e) The emergency order shall have a fixed period of 14 days unless a hearing is set  under section 624.7172 on an earlier date, in which case the order shall expire upon a judge's  finding that no order is issued under section 624.7172.\n (f) Except as provided in paragraph (g), the respondent shall be personally served  immediately with a copy of the emergency order and a copy of the petition and, if a hearing  is requested by the petitioner under section 624.7172, notice of the date set for the hearing.  If the petitioner does not request a hearing under section 624.7172, an order served on a  respondent under this section must include a notice advising the respondent of the right to  request a hearing challenging the issuance of the emergency order, and must be accompanied  by a form that can be used by the respondent to request a hearing.\n (g) Service of the emergency order may be made by alternate service as provided under  section 624.7172, subdivision 1, paragraph (e), provided that the petitioner files the affidavit  required under that subdivision. If the petitioner does not request a hearing under section  624.7172, the petition mailed to the respondent's residence, if known, must be accompanied  by the form for requesting a hearing described in paragraph (f).\n[624.7175] TRANSFER OF FIREARMS.\n (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), upon issuance of an extreme risk protection  order, the court shall direct the respondent to transfer any firearms the person possesses as  soon as reasonably practicable, but in no case later than 24 hours, to a federally licensed  firearms dealer or a law enforcement agency. If the respondent elects to transfer the  respondent's firearms to a law enforcement agency, the agency must accept the transfer.  The transfer may be permanent or temporary. A temporary firearm transfer only entitles  the receiving party to possess the firearm and does not transfer ownership or title. If the  respondent makes a temporary transfer, a federally licensed firearms dealer or law  enforcement agency may charge the respondent a reasonable fee to store the firearms and  may establish policies for disposal of abandoned firearms, provided these policies require  that the respondent be notified prior to disposal of abandoned firearms. If a respondent  permanently transfers the respondent's firearms to a law enforcement agency, the agency  is not required to compensate the respondent and may charge the respondent a reasonable  processing fee.\n (b) A person directed to transfer any firearms pursuant to paragraph (a) may transfer  any antique firearm, as defined in United States Code, title 18, section 921, paragraph (a),  clause (16), as amended, or a curio or relic as defined in Code of Federal Regulations, title  27, section 478.11, as amended, to a relative who does not live with the respondent after  confirming that the relative may lawfully own or possess a firearm.\n (c) The respondent must file proof of transfer as provided in this paragraph.\n (1) A law enforcement agency or federally licensed firearms dealer accepting transfer  of a firearm pursuant to this section shall provide proof of transfer to the respondent. The  proof of transfer must specify whether the firearms were permanently or temporarily  transferred and must include the name of the respondent, date of transfer, and the serial  number, manufacturer, and model of all transferred firearms. If transfer is made to a federally  licensed firearms dealer, the respondent shall, within two business days after being served  with the order, file a copy of proof of transfer with the law enforcement agency and attest  that all firearms owned or possessed at the time of the order have been transferred in  accordance with this section and that the person currently does not possess any firearms. If  the respondent claims not to own or possess firearms, the respondent shall file a declaration  of nonpossession with the law enforcement agency attesting that, at the time of the order,  the respondent neither owned nor possessed any firearms, and that the respondent currently  neither owns nor possesses any firearms. If the transfer is made to a relative pursuant to  paragraph (b), the relative must sign an affidavit under oath before a notary public either  acknowledging that the respondent permanently transferred the respondent's antique firearms,  curios, or relics to the relative or agreeing to temporarily store the respondent's antique  firearms, curios, or relics until such time as the respondent is legally permitted to possess  firearms. To the extent possible, the affidavit shall indicate the serial number, make, and  model of all antique firearms, curios, or relics transferred by the respondent to the relative.\n (2) The court shall seal affidavits, proofs of transfer, and declarations of nonpossession  filed pursuant to this paragraph.\n (d) If a court issues an emergency order under section 624.7174, or makes a finding of  immediate and present danger under section 624.7172, subdivision 2, paragraph (f), and  there is probable cause to believe the respondent possesses firearms, the court shall issue a  search warrant to the local law enforcement agency to take possession of all firearms in the  respondent's possession as soon as practicable. The local law enforcement agency shall,  upon written notice from the respondent, transfer the firearms to a federally licensed firearms  dealer. Before a local law enforcement agency transfers a firearm under this paragraph, the  agency shall require the federally licensed firearms dealer receiving the firearm to submit  a proof of transfer that complies with the requirements for proofs of transfer established in  paragraph (c). The agency shall file all proofs of transfer received by the court within two  business days of the transfer. A federally licensed firearms dealer who accepts a firearm  transfer pursuant to this paragraph shall comply with paragraphs (a) and (c) as if accepting  transfer directly from the respondent. If the law enforcement agency does not receive written  notice from the respondent within three business days, the agency may charge a reasonable  fee to store the respondent's firearms. A law enforcement agency may establish policies for  disposal of abandoned firearms, provided these policies require that the respondent be  notified prior to disposal of abandoned firearms.\n[624.7176] RETURN OF FIREARMS.\n Subdivision 1.\nLaw enforcement.\nA local law enforcement agency that accepted  temporary transfer of firearms under section 624.7175 shall return the firearms to the  respondent upon request after the expiration of the order, provided the respondent is not  otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal law.\n Subd. 2.\nFirearms dealer.\nA federally licensed firearms dealer that accepted temporary  transfer of firearms under section 624.7175 shall return the transferred firearms to the  respondent upon request after the expiration of the order, provided the respondent is not  otherwise prohibited from possessing firearms under state or federal law.

If, as of December 31 of an even-numbered year, the dollar value of  all coupons redeemed during that year and the immediately preceding odd-numbered year  exceeds 75 percent of the aggregated redemption value cap for those two years, the  redemption value cap must be increased by an additional two percent of the total value of  all coupons issued by the secretary of state each year, beginning in the next odd-numbered  year and for every year thereafter. The redemption value cap may be subsequently increased  in two percent increments according to the standards in this paragraph but may not exceed  16 percent of the total value of coupons issued unless otherwise expressly authorized by  law. No later than January 30 of each year, the board, in consultation with the commissioner  of management and budget, must certify the applicable redemption value cap that applies  during that year.\n Subd. 2.\nRedemption procedures.\nA candidate or political party unit that has been  assigned a Democracy Dollar coupon may submit it to the board for redemption. Assigned  coupons submitted directly to the board by the holder to which the coupon was issued are  presumed submitted for redemption on behalf of the assigned candidate or party unit.\n Subd. 3.\nVerification.\n(a) The board must verify the following before redeeming a  coupon:\n (1) the qualification of the receiving candidate or political party unit;\n (2) the eligibility of the person to whom the coupon was issued;\n (3) whether redemption of the coupon would result in the candidate receiving a  contribution in excess of the amounts authorized by law; and\n (4) whether redemption of the coupon would cause the total dollar value of redeemed  coupons to exceed the redemption value cap.\n (b) The board may require the assigned candidate or political party unit to submit  documents or records necessary to complete the verifications required by this subdivision.  The eligibility of the person to whom a coupon is issued must be confirmed by the secretary  of state.\n (c) The board must provide a notice to the original holder of a coupon and to the assigned  recipient if a coupon cannot be verified as eligible for redemption, the reason the coupon  could not be verified or redeemed, and, if applicable, instructions for reassigning the coupon  to another eligible recipient.\n Subd. 4.\nDistribution of contribution.\nUpon determination that the coupon is valid for  redemption, the board must disburse the value of the coupon to the assigned candidate's  principal campaign committee or to the treasurer of the assigned political party unit. The  board may adopt procedures for disbursement of the contribution through an electronic  funds transfer to the committee or party unit. These procedures are exempt from chapter  14, and section 14.386 does not apply.\n Subd. 5.\nEffect of coupons on contribution reporting and limits.\nThe value of the  coupon, once redeemed, must be recorded as a contribution made in the name of the person  to whom the coupon is issued. Redeemed coupons must be included in the calculation of  that person's contributions for purposes of reporting under section 10A.20, subdivision 3,  and for purposes of the contribution limits established in section 10A.27.\n Subd. 6.\nRedemption and distribution schedule.\nThe board must promptly verify all  assigned coupons received by the board, regardless of the method of submission. The board  must redeem all properly verified coupons and distribute contributions on a regular schedule,  at least two times per month, at least one time per week beginning 60 days prior to the date  of a state primary or state general election, and, to the extent practical, at least one time per  week during the campaign period preceding a special primary or special general election  as determined by the board.\n Subd. 7.\nAppropriation.\nAmounts necessary to redeem coupons and distribute the  resulting contributions required under this chapter are appropriated annually from the general  fund to the board. The amount appropriated to the board may not exceed the redemption  value cap for that year.\n[10B.09] USE OF CONTRIBUTION.\n A contribution received by a principal campaign committee or political party unit under  this chapter may only be used for purposes authorized under chapter 10A or section 211B.12.\n[10B.10] RETURN OF PROCEEDS; RULEMAKING.\n (a) A candidate who has redeemed a Democracy Dollar coupon and subsequently  withdraws as a candidate for office, dies, becomes ineligible, loses qualification, is defeated  in a primary or general election, or is elected at a general election must, within a reasonable  period, return any unspent coupon contribution proceeds to the board.\n (b) The board must adopt rules using the expedited rulemaking process in section 14.389  to establish accounting standards and other requirements for compliance with this section.\n[10B.11] VIOLATIONS; ENFORCEMENT.\n The board may make audits and investigations with respect to the requirements of this  chapter, consistent with the authority, procedures, and remedies provided in sections 10A.022  and 10A.34.\n(a) \n the terms defined in this  subdivision have the meanings given.

No amendment to this compact  shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws  of all member states.\n ARTICLE XIV\n CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\n This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The  provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision  of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or of the  United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance  is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof  to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this  compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact shall  remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect  as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.\n ARTICLE XV\n BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n (a) A licensee providing professional counseling services in a remote state under the  privilege to practice shall adhere to the laws and regulations, including scope of practice,  of the remote state.\n (b) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is  not inconsistent with the compact.\n (c) Any laws in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent  of the conflict.\n (d) Any lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and bylaws properly  promulgated by the commission, are binding upon the member states.\n (e) All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are  binding in accordance with their terms.\n (f) In the event any provision of the compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed  on the legislature of any member state, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the  conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.\n"

If the child is five years old or younger at the time that the parenting time schedule  is established and the order does not provide for equal parenting time for each parent, the  order must include a provision for a possible future modification of the parenting time order.\n (m) The court shall not consider the gender of a parent or a parent's marital status or  relationship status when making parenting time determinations under this section.\n (n) It is not a deviation from the parenting time presumption in paragraph (g) if:\n (1) the court awards parenting time of up to 53 percent to one parent and not below 47  percent to the other parent;\n (2) the court awards less than 50 percent parenting time to a parent when there is a  finding that domestic abuse has occurred as defined in section 518B.01 between the parents  or between a parent and child; or\n (3) the court awards less than 50 percent parenting time to a parent when that parent is  convicted of a qualified domestic violence-related offense as defined in section 609.02,  subdivision 16, when the domestic violence-related offense occurred between the parents  or between a parent and child.\n (o) When awarding parenting time, the court shall evaluate whether:\n (1) one parent has engaged in unwarranted interference between the child and the other  parent;\n (2) one parent has made false allegations of domestic abuse; and\n (3) one parent has chronically denied or minimized the parenting time of the other parent  in order to gain advantage in custody matters.\n"
